## Unreleased

* Add `ShmBlobArena` host capability to `lazily.ipc` — ports the `lazily-rs`
  `ShmBlobArena<B>` shared-memory blob arena and mirrors `lazily-zig`
  `ShmBlobArena`: a `bytearray`-backed arena with a 40-byte header
  (`LZSH` magic + FNV-1a-64 checksum), append-only writes with wraparound, and
  full read validation. A Python process can now host blob payloads (not just
  carry `ShmBlobRef` descriptors). Descriptors are byte-compatible with the
  Rust and Zig arenas. Exports `ShmBlobArena`, `ShmBlobArenaError` (with six
  variant subclasses), and `SHM_BLOB_HEADER_LEN`.

## 0.11.0

* Add `lazily.ipc`: the language-agnostic `lazily-spec` IPC wire protocol
  (Snapshot / Delta) with JSON byte-compatible with the Rust and Zig bindings —
  `IpcMessage`, `Snapshot`, `Delta`, the 7 `DeltaOp` variants, `NodeState` /
  `IpcValue` / `ShmBlobRef`, epoch sequencing (`apply_status` / resync), and a
  default-deny `PeerPermissions` boundary that omits non-readable nodes.
* Add conformance tests against the canonical `lazily-spec/conformance` fixtures
  (vendored under `tests/conformance/` for standalone CI).
* Add the eager `Signal` primitive — the third member of the
  `Slot → Cell → Signal` family (`signal` / `signal_def` decorators, eager
  recompute with a memo guard, `dispose()` reverts to lazy).
* Fix `RecursionError` when a `Signal` reads a `Slot` dependency: `Slot.__call__`
  no longer fires `touch()` during computation (computation must not cascade
  invalidation), and `Slot.reset` clears subscribers before notification so a
  subscriber-triggered reset cannot mutually recurse.

## D.10.0

* Fix cell type inference.
* Drop support for python version <3.12.
* Use uv + mise for development package management.

## 0.9.0

* Add type-aware context to slot and cell functions.
* The ctx argument type can be enforced via mypy.
* mypy tests now pass

## 0.8.0

* Add Cell.get() as an alias to Cell.value
* Add Cell.set(value) as an alias to Cell.value = value

## 0.7.0

* Add @slot_def and @cell_def decorators...which both take a resolve_ctx callable to resolve the ctx object.
* Allows for calling a slot function with an object that contains the ctx, such as a Request or Graphene
  GraphQLResolveInfo.

## 0.6.0

* cell() is supported with a default value of None.

## 0.5.0

* Slot now support subscriptions. Resetting a slot will also reset it's descendents.

## 0.4.0

* BREAKING CHANGE: Rename Cell to Slot and @cell to @slot.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Cell is now a subscribable that resets a parent Slots when it changes.

## 0.3.0

* BREAKING CHANGE: Rename be to cell and Be to Cell.

## 0.2.0

* BREAKING CHANGE: Remove be_class due to complexity. If a subclass of Be is needed, then users are encouraged to use
  create a singleton instance of the subclass.

## 0.1.0

* Initial release
