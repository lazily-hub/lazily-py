#
# Fails the build when the canonical corpus in ../lazily-spec/conformance/ grows a
# fixture that no test in this repo even mentions. That is the drift this guard
# exists for: a fixture lands upstream, every binding stays green, and nobody
# learns that one of them is not replaying it.
#
# This binding uses the RUNTIME manifest (#lazilyupgradeconformance), not the
# static grep it started with. The test run records every file it actually reads
# from the conformance corpus, so a fixture named in a comment but hand-transcribed
# — the drift found in lazily-cpp's queue tests — is caught here. A source grep
# cannot see that case at all.
#
# A missing manifest is missing EVIDENCE and fails. It does not mean "no fixtures
# were read"; it means the suite ran without the recorder attached, and passing in
# that state is the vacuous green this guard exists to prevent.
#
# The same reasoning is why this script ends with a positive-evidence FLOOR
# (#lzvacuousrun). Every check between here and there is a statement about the
# fixtures the run opened, and every one of them is trivially satisfied when that
# set is empty. Reporting "coverage OK" after examining zero fixtures is the
# failure mode, not a degenerate case of success, so the magnitude is asserted
# before OK is printed.

# ---- Positive-evidence floor (#lzvacuousrun) ----
# Everything above reasons about fixtures this run OPENED, so all of it is
# vacuously satisfied by an empty population: zero fixtures means zero uncovered
# fixtures and zero stale excuses. The loops cannot distinguish "nothing is
# wrong" from "nothing was examined", so assert the MAGNITUDE explicitly before
# reporting OK. Do not lower these to fix a red run — a drop here means the
# corpus or the recorder shrank, which is the finding.
#
# MIN_FIXTURES tracks WHAT CI ACTUALLY OPENS, exactly — no margin, no slack.
# Pinned 2026-08-09 from CI run 31343738442 against the published corpus:
# 139/150 canonical fixtures OPENED. A local `make test` on the same commit
# reproduced that number.
#
# It previously sat at 132, on a "keep a fixed slack of four below the real
# number" convention. That convention is the bug, and the slack did not stay
# fixed: the real number moved to 139 while the floor stayed at 132, so seven
# replayed fixtures could have stopped being opened with this guard still green.
# The same convention rotted lazily-zig's scenario floor to 91 against 147
# (#lzscenariofloordrift). Do not reintroduce a margin. When a change genuinely
# adds replays, re-read the `conformance coverage OK` line from a COMPLETED CI
# run — which clones the published corpus (#lzspecpushbeforebindings) rather than
# trusting a working tree — and set this to that total.
#
# An upstream fixture that lands without a Python runner raises `total` and
# leaves `covered` alone, so it does not trip this; only a replay that STOPS
# running does. The env override exists for bisecting an upstream corpus change,
# not for making a red run green.
# 2026-08-11: 139 -> 141. lazily-spec 39df4b3 (already on origin/main, so CI's
# clone has it) added lossless-tree/apply_update_advances_counter.json and
# lossless-tree/out_of_order_delivery_buffers.json, and this binding now replays
# both (#lzspecoutoforderfixtures). Corpus 150 -> 152, opened 139 -> 141, held
# exactly — no margin, per the paragraph above.
# 2026-09-11: 141 -> 145. The pin had drifted four fixtures behind the live
# count while the corpus grew to 156 — the exact rot the paragraph above warns
# about (#lzscenariofloordrift). Re-pinned from a completed
# `poe conformance_coverage` run against lazily-spec 4010d99 (on origin/main,
# so CI's clone has it): 145/156 OPENED, 11 KNOWN_UNCOVERED. Held exactly — 146
