# Fails the build when the canonical corpus in ../lazily-spec/conformance/ grows a
# fixture that no test in this repo even mentions. That is the drift this guard
# exists for: a fixture lands upstream, every binding stays green, and nobody
# learns that one of them is not replaying it.
#
# This binding uses the RUNTIME manifest (#lazilyupgradeconformance), not the
# static grep it started with. The test run records every file it actually reads
# from the conformance corpus, so a fixture named in a comment but hand-transcribed
# — the drift found in lazily-cpp's queue tests — is caught here. A source grep
# cannot see that case at all.
#
# A missing manifest is missing EVIDENCE and fails. It does not mean "no fixtures
# were read"; it means the suite ran without the recorder attached, and passing in
# that state is the vacuous green this guard exists to prevent.
#
# The same reasoning is why this script ends with a positive-evidence FLOOR
# (#lzvacuousrun). Every check between here and there is a statement about the
# fixtures the run opened, and every one of them is trivially satisfied when that
# set is empty. Reporting "coverage OK" after examining zero fixtures is the
# failure mode, not a degenerate case of success, so the magnitude is asserted
# before OK is printed.

# ---- Positive-evidence floor (#lzvacuousrun) ----
# Everything above reasons about fixtures this run OPENED, so all of it is
# vacuously satisfied by an empty population: zero fixtures means zero uncovered
# fixtures and zero stale excuses. The loops cannot distinguish "nothing is
# wrong" from "nothing was examined", so assert the MAGNITUDE explicitly before
# reporting OK. Do not lower these to fix a red run — a drop here means the
# corpus or the recorder shrank, which is the finding.
#
# There is NO fixture COUNT pinned here any more (#lzledgerceiling). There was:
# a MIN_FIXTURES bash default of 145 with a same-named env override, compared
# `covered -lt MIN_FIXTURES`. Deliberately not restated in its literal form: the
# upstream audit (lazily-spec scripts/check-corpus-floors.mjs) greps this whole
# `scripts/` directory for that exact spelling, so quoting it here would have the
# audit keep deriving and comparing a pin that no longer runs — a retired floor
# reported as a live one.
#
# It mirrored a number the set checks above already fix exactly. With zero errors
# reported, every canonical fixture outside KNOWN_UNCOVERED was opened, every
# KNOWN_UNCOVERED entry exists in the corpus, and none of them was opened — so
# `covered` IS `total` minus the ledger, which is 156 - 11 = 145, the pin's own
# value. Equal sets have equal counts: the pin carried no information the loops
# had not already established, and it could not fire. Demonstrated rather than
# argued: dropping `arena_blob.json` from the runtime manifest takes `covered` to
# 144, one under the old pin, and the run dies at "canonical fixture
# 'arena_blob.json' was NOT opened by the suite" — the earlier `exit 1`, reached
# before the floor is evaluated at all.
#
# What it did cost was real. It was a hand-retyped literal read off a CI log, and
# its own comment block was a ledger of the rot: 132 -> 139 -> 141 -> 145, with
# the 132 pin sitting seven fixtures behind the live count and the 141 pin four
# behind (#lzscenariofloordrift). A number that must be re-pinned whenever the
# corpus moves is an edit site that drifts, and `-lt` cannot see the drift.
#
# The one thing the pin asserted that the set checks do NOT imply is kept below,
# at ZERO: if KNOWN_UNCOVERED ever excused the WHOLE corpus, every loop above
# would be silent and `covered` would be 0 with nothing wrong reported. That is a
# ceiling on how much may be excused, spelled as a floor on what must remain — it
# is policy, it does not move with the corpus, and it never needs re-pinning.
# The block-level ledger carries the same kind of policy in
# `_EXPECTED_LEDGERED_BLOCKS` in tests/conformance_assert.py — pinned there as an
# exact size rather than a bound, because a bound that only refuses growth gains
# slack with every migration and stops firing (#lzledgerratchet).
