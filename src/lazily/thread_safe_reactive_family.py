"""Thread-safe keyed reactive collection (``#reactivemap``, thread-safe flavor) —
the :class:`~lazily.ThreadSafeContext` analog of :class:`~lazily.ReactiveMap`.

The Python counterpart of ``lazily-rs/src/thread_safe_reactive_family.rs``, the
Lean ``LazilyFormal.Materialization`` confluence theorems in ``lazily-formal``,
and ``lazily-spec/cell-model.md`` § "Execution-context flavors".

Keys ``K`` map to per-entry reactive nodes (:class:`~lazily.Cell` inputs /
:class:`~lazily.slot` derived nodes) whose writes are serialized through an
owning :class:`~lazily.ThreadSafeContext`. The present-set state is guarded by its
own lock so a keyed map can be materialized concurrently from multiple threads.

Its two specializations are :class:`ThreadSafeCellMap` (input cells) and
:class:`ThreadSafeSlotMap` (derived slots). Eager materialization is a pre-mint
loop (:meth:`ThreadSafeSlotMap.materialize_all`); lazy is mint-on-access
(:meth:`ThreadSafeReactiveMap.get_or_insert_with`) — there is no eager/lazy mode
flag. What the thread-safe flavor adds is **materialization confluence** (proved
in ``lazily-formal`` as ``materialize_present_comm`` / ``materialize_observe_comm``):
:meth:`ThreadSafeReactiveMap._mint_with` computes the node **outside** the lock,
then commits under it **first-writer-wins**, so a raced key keeps a single stable
handle.
