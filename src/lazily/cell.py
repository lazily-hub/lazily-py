    :data:`Source` — the value comes from *outside* (``set`` / ``merge``), the
    writable value kind. ``Cell`` is the value-node concept and stays the native
    class name (for mypyc native-struct reads and ``isinstance`` stability across
    the family); :data:`Source` is the concrete handle bound to it. A
    :class:`~lazily.merge.MergeCell` is a ``Source`` whose write folds under a
    non-``KeepLatest`` policy (``Cell ≡ Source(KeepLatest)``).

    **No reactive in this library exposes an observer API** — not Cell, not
    :class:`~lazily.signal.Computed`. Observation in this graph is a declared
    dependency edge, not a registered callback: read the cell from a
    :class:`~lazily.signal.Computed` or :class:`~lazily.effect.Effect` and that
    reader becomes a dependent, which is
    what makes batching and glitch-freedom hold. A callback registry bypasses
    all of that and costs memory on every reactive whether or not anyone
    subscribes.

    Where a caller genuinely needs a stream of *every* transition rather than
    the settled value, that is a :class:`~lazily.queue.Topic`.
