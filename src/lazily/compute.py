"""The fortified compute view — value-threaded dependency tracking.

The Python mirror of ``lazily-rs``'s ``Compute`` / ``ComputeOps`` (``#lzcellkernel``;
``lazily-spec/cell-model.md`` § "Dependency tracking (the fortified compute
view)"). Dependency tracking is **value-threaded, not ambient**: the identity of
the node being recomputed — *which* node a read must attribute to — is carried
into the compute function **as a value**, through a per-recompute
:class:`Compute` view, rather than read out of a module-global "current node"
stack.

Why value-threading (normative, per the spec): an ambient carrier is *clobbered
across suspension*. An ``async`` compute that reads a dependency after an
``await`` would attribute it to whatever else ran on the executor. A value
threaded through the closure is *captured*, so it survives suspension. Python
*does* provide a suspension-surviving ambient carrier (``contextvars``), and a
binding MAY use it (the spec permits it) — but the lazily **family choice is
uniform value-threading**, so we thread the value here to match ``lazily-rs`` and
the JS/Zig bindings that have no ambient carrier at all. (A ``contextvars``-based
variant would replace :class:`Compute`'s explicit ``node`` field with a
``ContextVar`` set for the recompute's duration; it is deliberately *not* used.)

Two surfaces implement the same compute-time operation subset
(:class:`ComputeOps` — the Python analog of ``lazily-rs``'s ``ComputeOps``
trait):

* :class:`Compute` — the **tracked** surface handed to a compute/effect closure.
  A read through it registers a dependency edge against *its* node
  (value-threaded). It is the **sole** tracking surface.
* :class:`Context` — the **untracked** surface (the owning context). A read
  through it registers no edge; it is the explicit untracked escape, reached
  from a :class:`Compute` via :meth:`Compute.untracked`.

Fortification (as far as Python allows):

* **Sole tracking surface** — a tracked read is available only through
  :class:`Compute`; :meth:`Compute.untracked` is the one explicit escape.
* **Non-escapable** — Python cannot enforce this by lifetime the way
  ``lazily-rs`` does (``!Send`` + a borrow that cannot outlive the recompute).
  It is enforced instead by **convention plus a runtime guard**: the view is
  *closed* when its recompute ends, and any read on a closed view raises
  :class:`StaleComputeError` — so a view stored and replayed later cannot
  silently register an edge against the wrong (already-finished) node.
* **Edge-attribution invariant** — because the node is a *value field* of the
  view, every edge a recompute registers has that node as its dependent, by
  construction (``lazily-rs`` proves this as
  ``registerReads_dependent_is_recomputing_node``).

:class:`Compute` is the **value-threaded** tracking surface, and it doubles as a
*dict-proxying* context view (carrying the recomputing node as ``node`` plus the
stable ``underlying`` dict), so an existing ``def f(ctx): ...ctx-as-dict...`` body
keeps working unchanged while a ``ctx.read(node)`` (and the ``name(ctx).value``
:class:`~lazily.slot.BoundHandle` path) attributes edges by value.

``#lzcellkernel`` — value-threading is the **sole** tracking surface; the ambient
``slot_stack`` bridge has been **deleted**. A tracked read reaches a node only
through a compute view (``ctx.read`` / the ``name(ctx).value``
:class:`~lazily.slot.BoundHandle` path); a bare ``obj.value`` / ``obj.get()`` with
no view in scope is simply untracked. Every reactive-body read that must track —
in the feature modules and the test suite — threads the caller's view (feature
readers take an optional ``ctx``; keyed-collection factories take the compute view
first, ``Callable[[C, K], V]``). The thread-safe / async engines keep their own
scoping and are untouched.
