"""Reactive queue — ``QueueCell`` SPSC/MPSC + pluggable ``QueueStorage`` backend.

The Python counterpart of ``lazily-spec/cell-model.md`` § "Reactive queues" and
the Lean ``LazilyFormal.QueueCell`` formal model. A :class:`QueueCell` is a FIFO
collection composed of reactive cells — **not a new cell kind** — that adds
queue semantics (push to tail, pop from head) to the reactive graph.

It is specified as a **single-producer, single-consumer (SPSC)** primitive;
**MPSC** (multi-producer) is a *usage rule* on the same primitive — multiple
producers push inside a :func:`lazily.batch` boundary, and the batch serializes
the pushes into a deterministic order. There is no separate ``MPSCQueueCell``
type.

Shell vs storage
----------------

The reactive shell owns the reader-kind version cells (``head`` / ``len`` /
``is_empty`` / ``is_full`` / ``closed``) and the invalidation logic; it is
storage-agnostic. The storage backend owns the actual FIFO data structure and is
pluggable via the :class:`QueueStorage` protocol. The default
:class:`VecDequeStorage` is an unbounded deque; a bounded variant exposes
reactive backpressure via ``is_full``.

Reader-kind invalidation
------------------------

Invalidation is scoped to **reader kind**, not to individual positions. A push
invalidates ``len`` / ``is_empty`` readers (and ``head`` when transitioning from
empty, and ``is_full`` when transitioning to capacity); a pop invalidates
``head`` / ``len`` / ``is_empty`` readers (and ``is_full`` when transitioning off
capacity). The head reader observes the *current* head value — after a pop, the
head reader sees the next element (or ``None``), not a stale value.

This reader-kind independence is implemented for free by the existing ``!=``
(PartialEq) guard on :class:`lazily.cell.Cell`: after each op the shell re-derives
each reader-kind cell from the storage and writes it back, and a cell whose value
did not change is not invalidated.

Example
-------

>>> from lazily import QueueCell, batch
>>> ctx = {}
>>> q: QueueCell[str] = QueueCell(ctx)
>>> _ = q.try_push("a")
>>> _ = q.try_push("b")
>>> q.head()
'a'
>>> q.len()
2
>>> q.try_pop()
'a'
>>> q.try_pop()
'b'
>>> q.is_empty()
True
>>> # MPSC: multiple producers push inside one batch → one invalidation pass.
>>> batch(lambda: (q.try_push("p1"), q.try_push("p2"), q.try_push("p3")))
>>> q.len()
3
