"""RelayCell backpressure plan (#relaycell), Phases 2-6 — the Python port.

See ``lazily-spec/docs/relaycell.md`` and ``relaycell-backpressure-analysis.md``.
A :class:`RelayCell` is an *algebra-typed conflating relay*: it accumulates a
fast ingress into a **hot head** (a :class:`~lazily.merge.MergePolicy` fold),
bounds it with a reactive :class:`BackpressurePolicy`, and lets a slow egress
**drain** the coalesced window. The converged egress state is independent of the
drain schedule whenever the merge ``⊕`` is associative (the ``relay_converges``
invariant, pinned in ``LazilyFormal.Relay``).

Phase 2 ``RelayCell`` + ``BackpressurePolicy`` · Phase 3 ``SpillStore`` ·
Phase 4 ``Transport`` · Phase 5 ``Outbox``/``Inbox`` roles · Phase 6
``RatePolicy``/``WindowPolicy``/``ExpiryPolicy``/``PriorityStorage``/
``KeyedRelay``. Time is a logical clock (a monotone tick) so behaviour is
deterministic and portable.

It is a *composite*, not a new node: the hot head is a :class:`~lazily.cell.Cell`
and its ``depth``/``is_full``/``is_empty`` reads are demand-driven
:func:`~lazily.slot.slot` handles, so an unobserved relay costs ``N·⊕`` and no
more (the merge cost law).
