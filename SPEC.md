# lazily-py Specification

Python library for lazy evaluation with context-aware dependency injection and cache invalidation.

## Core Concepts

### Context

A plain `dict` serves as the context. Slots use themselves as dictionary keys to store cached values. No dedicated Context class — any dict works.

### Slot

Lazily-computed cached value with automatic dependency tracking via a global `slot_stack`.

**Types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `BaseSlot[C_in, C_ctx, T]` | Base slot without dependency tracking |
| `Slot[C_in, C_ctx, T]` | Slot with dependency tracking and invalidation |
| `slot[C_ctx, T]` | Convenience: Slot with identity context resolver |
| `slot_def(resolve_ctx)` | Decorator factory for custom context resolvers |

**BaseSlot methods:**

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `__call__(ctx)` | Compute or return cached value |
| `get(ctx)` | Return cached value or `None` |
| `reset(ctx)` | Clear cached value |
| `is_in(ctx)` | Check if value is cached |

**Slot additions:**

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `touch(ctx)` | Invalidate dependents |
| `reset(ctx)` | Clear cache + invalidate dependents. Downstream edges are rebound to `None` before propagating, so a re-entered reset finds an empty set. |

### Source

Mutable value holder that notifies dependent slots when changed.

**Types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Source[T]` | Native mutable value with subscription support |
| `SourceSlot[C_in, C_ctx, T]` | Native slot that returns a Source |
| `source[C_ctx, T]` | Convenience: SourceSlot with identity resolver |
| `source_def(resolve_ctx)` | Decorator factory for custom context resolvers |
| `Cell` / `CellSlot` | Identity-preserving migration aliases |
| `cell` / `cell_def` | Deprecated constructor aliases |

**Source operations:**

| Property/Method | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| `cell.value` (get) | Read value; auto-subscribes calling slot |
| `cell.value = x` (set) | Update value; invalidate dependents if changed |
| `cell.get()` | Alias for value getter |
| `cell.set(x)` | Alias for value setter |
| `cell.touch()` | Invalidate dependents |

**No reactive exposes an observer API** — neither `Source` nor `Computed`.
Observation is a declared dependency edge — read the cell from a `Computed` or
`Effect` — not a registered callback. For a stream of every transition, use
`Topic`.

### Eager Computed

Eager derived value — `computed(ctx, f).eager()`. Where a lazy `Computed`
marks itself dirty on invalidation and recomputes on the next read, an **eager**
`Computed` computes once at construction and recomputes immediately whenever a
tracked dependency changes. It is composed from existing primitives — a memoized
backing `Slot` plus a puller `Effect` that re-pulls the slot when it is
invalidated — and applies the PartialEq guard so an eager recompute that yields
an equal value suppresses the downstream cascade. (`.eager()` is idempotent and
returns the same handle; `.lazy()` reverses it.)

**Types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Signal[T]` | Eager derived value bound to a single context |
| `signal(callable)` | Decorator: context-cached eager-Signal factory (one Signal per context) |
| `signal_def(resolve_ctx)` | Decorator factory with a custom context resolver |

**Signal operations:**

| Property/Method | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| `signal.value` (get) | Read current value; auto-subscribes calling slot |
| `signal.get()` / `signal()` | Aliases for the value getter |
| `signal.touch()` | Invalidate dependents |
| `signal.is_active()` | Whether the eager puller is still installed |
| `signal.dispose()` | Remove the eager puller; value reverts to lazy (recomputed on next read) |

**Semantics:**

- **Eager activation:** the value is materialized at creation, so there is no
  intermediate unset state.
- **Memo guard:** an eager recompute that yields an equal value suppresses
  `touch()` and downstream invalidation, exactly like a memoized slot.
- **Once per flush, not once per write:** the puller is an `Effect`, so it is
  scheduled rather than run inline. N writes to a Signal's dependencies inside
  one `batch` (or one `ThreadSafeContext.batch`) re-materialize it exactly once,
  at the outermost exit.
- **Disposal removes only the puller:** the backing memo is untouched, so after
  `dispose()` the value stays readable, stays correct on read, and no longer
  re-materializes on write.
- **Wire representation:** a Signal is not a separate wire type. On the
  `lazily-spec` wire it is the ordinary backing slot node that stores its
  materialized value; the puller is local execution state and is never
  serialized. See **lazily-spec Compliance** below.

### Effect (sync)

A side-effecting observer that reruns whenever a tracked dependency invalidates.
An optional cleanup closure returned by the body runs before each rerun and on
dispose (cleanup-before-body ordering). Disposal is terminal.

**Types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Effect` | Sync reactive effect (extends `Slot` for dependency tracking) |
| `effect(body)` | Register an effect; `body(ctx) -> cleanup \| None` |

**Operations:**

| Property/Method | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| `effect(ctx)` | Run (or rerun) the body, auto-tracking dependencies |
| `effect.dispose()` | Deschedule, drop edges, run cleanup; terminal |
| `effect.disposed` | Whether `dispose()` has been called |

**Semantics:**

- **Auto-tracking:** pushes itself onto `slot_stack` during the body so every
  Cell/Slot/Signal read registers a dependency — the same mechanism as `Slot`.
- **Cleanup-before-body:** the previous run's cleanup closure completes before
  the next body starts.
- **Re-entrancy guard:** an invalidation fired while the body is executing
  schedules no extra rerun.
- **Batch coalescing:** inside a `batch`, reruns are queued for the coalesced
  effect flush at the outermost boundary (at most one rerun per batch).

The async counterpart (`AsyncEffect`) queues reruns at the batch boundary for
`asyncio` reactors.

### Batch

A top-level boundary that coalesces several cell writes into one invalidation +
effect flush. Multiple `Cell.value = x` writes inside a `batch` defer their
`touch()` to the outermost boundary, so a dependent reached through many changed
cells appears at most once per batch (the coalesced-frontier invariant).

**Types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `batch(run)` | Run `run`, queuing cell writes; flush one coalesced wave at exit |
| `batch_context()` | Context-manager form of `batch` |
| `in_batch()` | Whether the calling thread is currently inside a `batch` |

**Semantics:**

- **Coalesced cell touches:** writes inside the batch set the cell value but
  defer `touch()` to the outermost boundary; each changed cell is touched once.
- **Coalesced effect flush:** effects queued during the invalidation pass are
  deduplicated by identity and rerun once at the boundary.
- **Singleton refinement:** a one-write batch is observationally identical to a
  plain `Cell.set` (the `!=` PartialEq guard applies).
- **Nested:** only the outermost boundary flushes.

The lock-serialized counterpart that also linearizes concurrent writers lives at
`ThreadSafeContext.batch`.

### Struct bridge (`struct_source`)

A `StructSource[T]` is one struct value held as **per-field** `Source` cells plus
one guarded `Computed[T]` that re-materializes the struct from them. It is a
Python-side convenience over the kernel, not a wire-plane or cross-binding
obligation: it introduces no new node kind and no new invalidation rule.

**Types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `struct_source(ctx, instance)` / `struct_source(ctx, Type, **fields)` | Build a bridge |
| `StructSource.field(name)` / `s[name]` | The `Source` backing one field |
| `StructSource.struct` | The guarded `Computed[T]` re-materializing the struct |
| `StructSource.update(...)` / `.set_field(...)` / `.apply(instance)` | Batched writes |
| `StructBackend` | How one struct library is introspected and reconstructed |
| `register_struct_backend` / `resolve_struct_backend` / `struct_backends` | Backend registry |

**Semantics:**

- **Per-field edges:** a reader that reads `s[name]` depends on that field only;
  a sibling write forms no edge to it and never invalidates it.
- **Whole-struct guard:** `s.struct` is an ordinary guarded `Computed`, so a
  write that lands an equal value suppresses the cascade at the cell, and an
  equal re-materialization suppresses it again downstream.
- **One wave per update:** `update` and `apply` write through `batch`, so an
  N-field change invalidates each dependent at most once.
- **Bridged fields:** the `init` fields of the type, in declaration order.
  Non-`init` / derived fields are excluded — the constructor recomputes them, so
  they are not independent state.
- **Backends:** msgspec `Struct`, pydantic v2 `BaseModel`, `attrs`, stdlib
  `dataclasses`, stdlib `NamedTuple`, tried in that order. A backend's `matches`
  probe is structural and MUST NOT import its library; registered backends take
  precedence, and a registration replaces any built-in with the same `name`.
- **No new runtime dependency:** the optional-dependency extras
  (`lazily[msgspec]`, `[pydantic]`, `[attrs]`, `[structs]`) are install
  ergonomics and the CI test matrix; `import lazily` loads none of them.

### Workflow-safe context (`lazily.workflow`)

The durable-execution boundary. Python-side; no dependency on `temporalio` (the
engine is injected as a clock accessor plus a `WorkflowScheduler`).

**Types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `WorkflowClock(now, *, resolution_ns)` | lazily's logical tick bound to the engine's replayed clock |
| `WorkflowContext(ctx, clock, *, scheduler)` | Owns the driven `TimelineSource` set |
| `WorkflowContext.register/advance/next_wakeup` | Registration and clock-driven ticking |
| `WorkflowContext.schedule_next/activity` | Engine timer and activity hand-offs |
| `WorkflowScheduler` | `start_timer(delay)` / `start_activity(name, ...)` |
| `deterministic_scope()` | Raises `NonDeterminismError` on reachable non-determinism |

**Semantics:**

- **One reading per advance:** `advance` reads the clock once and ticks every
  registered source, so no two sources disagree about `now`.
- **Strict monotonicity:** a backwards clock reading raises rather than being
  clamped (`ManualClock` clamps; a replayed clock that regresses is a defect).
- **`next_wakeup` distinguishes `0` from `None`:** `0` is an already-due source
  and a real instruction to the engine; `None` means nothing is pending.
- **No engine, no effects:** `schedule_next` and `activity` raise
  `NonDeterminismError` when no scheduler was injected — a workflow cannot sleep
  or act except through the engine.
- **The guard is not a sandbox:** `deterministic_scope` rebinds module
  attributes and restores them on exit (including on an exception, and nesting
  safely). It cannot intercept `datetime.datetime.now()`, a reference bound
  before the scope opened, or C-internal calls; module re-import isolation is the
  correct layer for those.
- **Naming:** `lazily.temporal` is the time-operator family and is unrelated to
  temporal.io. The collision is documented in that module's docstring rather
  than renamed, because the name is public API in nine bindings.

### Replay-equivalence proof (`lazily.replay`)

The provability half of the durable-execution gate (`lazily.workflow` is the
other). Graph-agnostic: the subject is any object with `apply(event)` and
`observe() -> Mapping[str, Any]`.

**Types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ReplayEvent(seq, name, payload)` | One log entry |
| `ReplayLog(events)` / `.of` / `.from_records` | Ordered log, `digest` over canonical bytes |
| `replay_log_from_outbox(outbox, *, cursor)` | A log from `DurableOutbox.replay_from` |
| `ReplayGraph` | `apply(event)` / `observe()` — the subject protocol |
| `ReplayHarness(build, *, stride, deterministic)` | Rebuilds and drives the subject |
| `ReplayHarness.record/verify/check/prove` | Record, assert, report, self-check |
| `ReplayCheckpoint` / `ReplayFingerprint` | Per-cell digests, bound to a `log_digest` |
| `ReplayDivergence` | First diverging checkpoint, cell label, kind |
| `canonical_bytes` / `canonical_digest` | The type-tagged, order-stable encoding |
| `ReplayProofError` and subclasses | `ReplayEncodingError`, `ReplayLogMismatchError`, `ReplayDivergenceError` |

**Semantics:**

- **The contract:** given the same `ReplayLog`, a rebuilt graph observes the same
  values at every checkpoint. Any deviation is a defect in the graph, not a
  tolerance.
- **Revalidate before comparing:** `verify` and `check` compare `log_digest`
  first and raise `ReplayLogMismatchError` when it differs, so a stale
  fingerprint is deterministically suppressed rather than compared. `stride` is
  recorded too and a mismatch raises `ReplayProofError`; equal digest plus equal
  stride means the checkpoint sequence numbers cannot disagree.
- **First divergence wins:** comparison stops at the earliest diverging
  checkpoint, because later ones are the same defect carried forward. A cell that
  disappears from `observe` is `missing`; a new one is `unexpected`.
- **A fresh subject per replay:** `build` is called once per replay. `prove`
  records and re-replays (default 2 replays), which catches non-determinism with
  no recorded fingerprint at all.
- **Canonical or nothing:** the encoding is type-tagged and length-framed,
  orders mapping/set members by their own encoded bytes, encodes floats by
  `float.hex()` (exact, and `-0.0` ≠ `0.0`), and tags enums and dataclasses with
  their type name. An unencodable value raises `ReplayEncodingError`; there is no
  `repr` fallback, because an address-bearing `repr` would diverge every run.
- **Sequence numbers strictly increase but need not be contiguous:** an
  ack-truncated outbox replays real epochs, and the truncated prefix is visible
  in the log digest.
- **Hashing:** BLAKE2b-256 (`hashlib`), not BLAKE3 — no runtime dependency. Not
  wire-compatible with tsift's digests.

### Named keyed fold (`lazily.keyed_fold`)

**Types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `KeyedFold(ctx, summarize, *, policy, eager)` | The fold |
| `KeyedFold.claim(key)` | Exclusive ownership of one key |
| `KeyedFold.writer(key)` | A shared (non-exclusive) handle |
| `KeyedFoldWriter.set/merge/clear/release` | The whole writer surface |
| `KeyedFold.summary` | The guarded summary `Computed` |

**Semantics:**

- **Key ownership:** a writer's surface names only its own key, so it can
  publish and retract only its own contribution. `claim` raises
  `KeyAlreadyClaimedError` on a second claim of the same key.
- **Per-key isolation:** a reader of one key is not invalidated by a sibling
  write; the entries are independent cells in a `SourceMap`.
- **Guarded summary:** the summary depends on membership *and* on every live
  value, and on nothing else. An equal entry write is inert at the cell; a
  summary that does not move is inert at the `Computed`.
- **Merge seeding:** `merge` folds under `policy`, seeding a fresh key with the
  operand — a `MergePolicy` is an associative merge, not a monoid, so there is
  no identity to start from. `set` bypasses the policy.
- **Eager by default,** matching `HealthCell`: the summary re-projects after
  every write so a summary reader is invalidated only on a real change.
  `eager=False` defers the fold to the first read and forgoes that guard.

### Metrics family (`lazily.metrics`)

A Python-side surface over the kernel, not a cross-binding obligation: it adds
no node kind, no invalidation rule, and no canonical fixture.

**Types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `MetricsRegistry(ctx)` | Named set of families plus text exposition |
| `MetricsRegistry.counter/gauge(name, doc, label_names)` | Get or create a family |
| `MetricFamily.labels(...)` / `.child()` | The writable child at a label set |
| `MetricFamily.derive(labels, compute, *, eager=False)` | Bind a graph read as the child |
| `CounterCell` / `GaugeCell` | A `Source`-backed child |
| `MetricFamilySnapshot` / `MetricSample` | A resolved family |
| `lazily.prometheus_egress.ReactiveCollector` | `prometheus_client` pull collector |

**Semantics:**

- **Counter monotonicity:** `inc` rejects a negative delta; `set` rejects a
  total below the current one. A counter can therefore never publish a decrease
  that a scraper would read as a process restart.
- **Gauge guard:** a gauge is one `Source`, so an equal `set` is inert.
- **Derived children are graph reads:** `derive` binds a `Computed` whose
  expression runs against the graph, so the exported value and the state it
  describes cannot disagree. The expression runs once at bind time to
  materialize the child.
- **Laziness is the default:** a derived child recomputes on collection, not on
  every upstream change. `eager=True` keeps a settled value, which is what makes
  the `Computed` guard observable to a reactive consumer of `observe`; a lazy
  child has no settled value to compare and so cannot suppress an equal
  recompute.
- **One kind per label set:** a label set holds a writable child or a derived
  child, never both — they disagree about who owns the value.
- **Collection is untracked by default.** A scrape is not a graph node; passing
  a compute view (`observe`) is the explicit opt-in to depend on every child.
- **Exposition is dependency-free:** `render_text` emits the Prometheus text
  format directly, including `+Inf` / `-Inf` / `NaN` and the documentation /
  label-value escapes. The `prometheus_client` adapter is optional, imported
  lazily, and a **pull** collector — it resolves the registry on each scrape.

## Dependency Tracking

Uses a global `slot_stack: list[Slot]` (acts as thread-local execution context).

1. When a Slot computes, it pushes itself onto `slot_stack`
2. Any child Slot or Cell accessed during computation sees the parent on the stack
3. The child records that parent in its `_parents` edge set (by identity); a later change calls `parent.reset()`
4. When a Cell value changes (and differs from old value), `touch()` cascades invalidation

**Key invariant:** Dependency edges are cleared on `reset()`, forcing re-registration on next access. This prevents stale edges.

## Invalidation Semantics

- `Cell.value = new_value` → if changed: `touch()` → `parent.reset()` → cascade
- `Slot.__call__(ctx)` → compute or return cached value; does **not** cascade invalidation (computation must not invalidate its own dependents — doing so destroys the edge being registered)
- `Slot.reset(ctx)` → clear cache → rebind downstream edges to `None` → push them onto the iterative invalidation work-stack → drain. Rebinding before propagation keeps a re-entered reset from finding stale edges.
- Value equality check: Cells only invalidate when `new_value != old_value`

## Context Resolvers

Custom context resolvers allow non-dict inputs to resolve to the underlying context dict:

```python
@slot_def(resolve_ctx)
def my_slot(ctx: dict) -> str:
    return "computed"

# Can be called with CustomCtxResolver or plain dict
result = my_slot(custom_resolver)
```

## Type System

- `LazilyCallable[C, T]` — Protocol for context-consuming callables
- `ResolveCallable[R, C]` — Protocol for context resolvers
- Full generic type annotations with `C_in`, `C_ctx` (bound to dict), `T`

## lazily-spec Compliance (IPC Wire Protocol)

`lazily.ipc` implements the language-agnostic [`lazily-spec`](https://github.com/lazily-hub/lazily-spec)
wire protocol so a Python reactive graph's state can be mirrored to remote
observers across processes and languages. The JSON representation is
**byte-compatible** with the Rust reference (`lazily-rs`) and the Zig binding.

### Wire types

| Type | Wire form |
|------|-----------|
| `IpcMessage` | Externally-tagged: `{"Snapshot": …}`, `{"Delta": …}`, or `{"CrdtSync": …}` |
| `Snapshot` | `{ epoch, nodes[], edges[], roots[] }` |
| `NodeSnapshot` | `{ node, type_tag, state, key? }` (`key` omitted when absent) |
| `NodeState` | `{"Payload": [u8…]}` \| `{"SharedBlob": {…}}` \| `"Opaque"` |
| `NodeKey` | Bare string path (`scores/alice`); optional on `NodeSnapshot` / `NodeAdd` |
| `EdgeSnapshot` | `{ dependent, dependency }` |
| `Delta` | `{ base_epoch, epoch, ops[] }` |
| `DeltaOp` | 7 variants: `CellSet`, `SlotValue`, `Invalidate`, `NodeAdd`, `NodeRemove`, `EdgeAdd`, `EdgeRemove` (`NodeAdd` carries an optional `key`) |
| `IpcValue` | `{"Inline": [u8…]}` \| `{"SharedBlob": {…}}` |
| `ShmBlobRef` | `{ offset, len, generation, epoch, checksum }` |
| `WireStamp` | `{ wall_time, logical, peer }` (CRDT HLC stamp mirror) |
| `CrdtOp` | `{ node, key, stamp, state }` (state-based / CvRDT) |
| `CrdtSync` | `{ frontier[], ops[] }` (anti-entropy multi-writer plane) |
| `CapabilityHandshake` | Standalone frame: `{ protocol_id, protocol_major_version, codec, … }` |

**Conventions matching the normative fixtures:**

- Enums are **externally tagged** (the variant name is the single JSON key).
- Wire-stable identifiers (`NodeId`, `PeerId`) are bare JSON integers; keep them
  ≤ `2**53` for JavaScript/TypeScript peers.
- Serialized value bytes are JSON **arrays of `u8`**, not base64.
- `NodeKey` is **additive**: a missing `key` field decodes to `None` (`null`),
  so pre-`key` encoders and existing conformance fixtures round-trip unchanged.
  A `None` `key` is omitted from `NodeSnapshot` / `NodeAdd` (self-describing
  codecs); `CrdtOp.key` is emitted as `null` when unset (matches the Rust
  derived struct). Path bounds (`NODE_KEY_MAX_LEN = 1024`, `NODE_KEY_MAX_SEGMENTS = 32`)
  are enforced on construction and on the wire.
- `IpcMessage.encode_json()` / `decode_json()` move transport-agnostic bytes
  (unix socket, pipe, WebSocket, WebRTC data channel, shared memory).
- `IpcMessage.encode_msgpack()` / `decode_msgpack()` speak the `msgpack`
  cross-language binary default. Same logical schema, same external tags, same
  field names, same omit-when-absent rule — the frame is serialized from the
  same `to_wire()` tree, so the two codecs cannot drift apart. Byte payloads
  stay **arrays of integers** (never MessagePack `bin`, which the reference
  decoder rejects in that position). Unlike `json`, `msgpack` is **not
  byte-canonical**: map key order is encoder-defined, so conformance is
  `decode(encode(m)) == m`, not a golden byte string.

### NodeKey

A `NodeKey` is a `/`-joined path (`scores/alice`, `outer/k1/inner/k2`) — an
optional wire-stable keyed address that survives `NodeId` churn. Unlike
`NodeId` (a volatile internal handle a producer may re-mint after a resync or
remove-then-readd), a key is producer-defined and stable, so a peer can
subscribe to "entry `scores/alice`" without an out-of-band key→NodeId map.

- `NodeKey.new(path)` / `NodeKey.from_segments(parts)` — validated construction
  (raises `NodeKeyError`: `Empty`, `TooLong`, `TooManySegments`, `EmptySegment`).
- `NodeSnapshot.with_key(key)` / `DeltaOp.node_add(node, type_tag, state, key)`
  attach a key; the `key` field is omitted from JSON when unset.

### Distributed: CRDT cell plane

`CrdtSync` rides the same `lazily-ipc` transport as `Snapshot`/`Delta` as a
third `IpcMessage` variant. It is the multi-writer anti-entropy plane
(`merge: crdt`): each `CrdtOp` ships a converged state-based register value
tagged with a `WireStamp` (the wire mirror of the runtime HLC stamp); the
`frontier` advertises the sender's per-peer highest observed stamp so the
receiver can compute the causal-stability watermark. Merges are commutative,
associative, and idempotent, so out-of-order or duplicated delivery converges.

- `CrdtSync.filter_readable(permissions, peer)` omits ops for non-readable
  nodes entirely (omission, not redaction) while retaining the full frontier.
- Wiring the plane to live `merge: crdt` root cells is a follow-on runtime slice;
  this binding ships the codec-stable wire types.

### Capability negotiation

`CapabilityHandshake` is the standalone frame exchanged before any graph state
flows (it is not an `IpcMessage` variant). Peers that disagree on
`protocol_major_version`, `codec`, or `ordered_reliable` fail closed before any
`Snapshot` or `Delta` is applied.

- `CapabilityHandshake.new(peer_id, session_id)` — protocol defaults (JSON codec,
  1 MiB frame, ordered-reliable, no features).
- `handshake.is_compatible_with(other)` — fail-closed compatibility check.
- Constants `PROTOCOL_ID = "lazily-ipc"`, `PROTOCOL_MAJOR_VERSION = 1`.

### Epoch sequencing

A context-level monotonic `ipc_epoch` advances once per outermost batch flush.
Each `Delta` carries `{ base_epoch, epoch }` with `epoch == base_epoch + 1`.

- `Delta.is_next_after(last_epoch)` — whether the delta applies in sequence.
- `Delta.apply_status(last_epoch)` — `DeltaApplyStatus.apply()` when sequential,
  else `DeltaApplyStatus.resync_required(last_epoch, base_epoch, epoch)`, which
  tells the receiver to discard the delta and request a fresh `Snapshot`.

### Shared-memory blob arena (host)

`ShmBlobArena` ports the `lazily-rs` `ShmBlobArena<B>` host capability
(`ipc.rs`) and mirrors `lazily-zig` `ShmBlobArena` (`ipc.zig`), so a Python
process can **host** shared-memory blob payloads rather than only carry
`ShmBlobRef` descriptors produced elsewhere. The arena is a flat `bytearray`
plus an append-only write cursor; each write emits a `ShmBlobRef` descriptor and
prepends a 40-byte header (`LZSH` magic, version, header length, generation,
epoch, payload length, FNV-1a-64 checksum). Reads validate bounds, the header,
generation/epoch/length, and the checksum before returning a zero-copy
`memoryview`. Append-only with wraparound; each write bumps a generation counter
so a stale descriptor landing on an overwritten region fails validation instead
of returning torn data. Descriptors are byte-compatible with the Rust and Zig
arenas (identical header layout + FNV-1a-64 constants).

- `ShmBlobArena.with_capacity(n)` / `ShmBlobArena.from_buffer(buf)` — allocate
  a fresh `bytearray` or wrap externally-owned storage (e.g. an `mmap` region
  cast to `bytearray`); caller keeps `buf` ownership in the latter case.
- `arena.write_blob(epoch, payload) -> ShmBlobRef`
- `arena.read_blob(ref) -> memoryview` (zero-copy, read-only)
- `arena.capacity` / `arena.max_blob_len` / `arena.write_offset`
- Errors: `ShmBlobArenaError` base with variants `ShmBlobCapacityTooSmall`,
  `ShmBlobTooLarge`, `ShmBlobDescriptorOutOfBounds`, `ShmBlobDescriptorMismatch`,
  `ShmBlobChecksumMismatch`, `ShmBlobGenerationOverflow` — matching the Rust enum
  and Zig error set. `SHM_BLOB_HEADER_LEN` is exported.

True cross-process OS shared memory (`/dev/shm`, `mmap`) is out of scope here
and is a follow-on that swaps the backing buffer; this port establishes the
in-process arena and host parity across siblings.

### Permission boundary (omission, not redaction)

`PeerPermissions` is a default-deny per-peer allowlist gating `read`, `write`,
and `trigger_effect` (`OpKind`) **independently** — a read grant never implies
write or effect-trigger. Non-readable nodes are **omitted entirely** from a
snapshot/delta (not redacted in place), so a peer cannot infer their existence:

- `Snapshot.filter_readable(permissions, peer)` — drops unreadable nodes; keeps
  an edge only when both endpoints are readable; preserves root order.
- `Delta.filter_readable(permissions, peer)` — drops ops whose target node (or
  either edge endpoint) is unreadable.
- `permissions.check(peer, op)` raises `PermissionDenied` (fail-closed).

### Conformance

`tests/test_conformance.py` validates the canonical `lazily-spec/conformance`
fixtures (preferring the sibling spec repo, falling back to a vendored copy under
`tests/conformance/`). Each test parses the fixture `wire` into a native
`IpcMessage`, asserts the language-agnostic `assertions`, and re-serializes to
confirm round-trip fidelity — the same contract the Rust and Zig bindings run.

## lazily-spec Compute-Layer Compliance

Beyond the wire protocol, lazily-py implements the `lazily-spec` compute-layer
`MUST`s, each ported from its Lean formal model in `lazily-formal` and covered
by property tests that mirror the named Lean theorems.

### Keyed reactive collections (`ReactiveMap` / `SourceMap` / `ComputedMap` / `SourceTree`)

One generic keyed primitive `ReactiveMap` over a handle kind (`#reactivemap`),
with two specializations: `SourceMap` (input-cell entries — adds cell-only `set`
and eager value-minting `entry`/`entry_with`) and `ComputedMap` (derived-slot entries
— `get_or_insert_with` mints a slot on first access for lazy materialization,
`materialize_all` pre-mints the keyset for eager; no `set`). No eager/lazy mode
flag — eager is a pre-mint loop, lazy is mint-on-access.

Three independent reactive signals: per-entry value, set-membership, and order.
A pure reorder (`move_to`) bumps the order signal only — `len`/`contains` readers
are not invalidated; an atomic move keeps each entry's handle identity (not remove
+ re-mint). A key resolves to a stable handle across requests (identity
stability). `SourceTree` extends the model to an ordered keyed tree with per-node
value and per-level membership/order reactivity.

- `ReactiveMap.get_or_insert_with` / `.remove` / `.move_to` / `.move_before` /
  `.move_after`; `membership_signal` / `order_signal`; `SourceMap.entry` / `.set`;
  `ComputedMap.materialize_all`.
- `SourceTree.set_node_value` / `.insert_child` / `.move_child`.

### Keyed reconciliation (`reconcile_ops`)

The move-minimized `{insert, remove, move, update}` op set a level diff emits by
stable key, over a longest-increasing-subsequence (LIS) kernel. Keys already in
relative order (the LIS) do NOT move; a stable entry with an unchanged value is
neither moved nor updated — so its value cell is untouched. Replays the
`lazily-spec/conformance/collections/keyed_reconciliation_lis.json` fixture.

### Async reactive context (`AsyncSlot` / `AsyncEffect`)

The `Empty / Computing / Resolved / Error` slot lifecycle with revision-tracked
stale-completion discard — a stale completion is never published. `AsyncEffect`
serializes reruns cleanup-before-body and schedules them at the outermost batch
boundary (invalidation only queues, never runs inline); disposal is terminal.
The pure `step` kernels (`lazily.async_slot.step` / `lazily.async_effect.step`)
mirror `LazilyFormal.AsyncSlotState` / `AsyncEffect`.

### Thread-safe reactive context (`ThreadSafeContext`)

A lock-serialized `batch(run)` that queues cell writes and flushes them in one
coalesced invalidation pass at the outermost boundary — the "coalesced frontier:
a dependent reached through many changed cells in one batch appears at most once
per delta" invariant. A singleton batch refines the single-threaded `Cell.set`.

### C-ABI FFI boundary (`lazily.ffi`)

`LazilyFfiStatus` (0 Ok / 1 Empty / 2 NullPointer / 3 InvalidMessage /
4 EncodeFailed / 5 Panic), `LazilyFfiMessageKind` (0 Unknown / 1 Snapshot /
2 Delta / **3 CrdtSync** — the spec mandates the kind discriminant carries
`CrdtSync`), `LazilyFfiBytes` (`ptr`/`len`), and `encode_message` /
`decode_message` re-encoding an `IpcMessage` to canonical JSON bytes
byte-compatible with the Rust/Zig FFI boundaries.

### Cell-model layers (`lazily.semtree` / `stable_id` / `textcrdt` / `seqcrdt`)

The `lazily-spec` cell-model § "Free-text CRDT", § "Move-aware sequence order",
§ "Memoized semantic tree", and § "Manufactured identity" layers, each pinned by
its `conformance/collections/*.json` fixture:

- **`SemTree`** — memoized semantic tree. One memo slot per node folds
  `(node value, child derived values)`; editing one node recomputes only its
  ancestor chain (a sibling subtree stays cached), and a node edit that does not
  change the folded result re-runs no downstream consumer (memo equality guard).
- **`stable_id`** — manufactured identity for text. Three layers: in-band
  anchors (`a:<anchor>`), content-derived hashes (`c:<hash>` over
  whitespace-normalized text), and word-LCS similarity alignment
  (`>= 0.5` ⇒ `Edited`/key-inherited; below ⇒ `Inserted`).
- **`TextCrdt`** — Fugue/RGA-style character CRDT. Order is pre-order DFS of the
  origin tree, siblings sorted DESCENDING by `OpId`; merge is
  commutative/associative/idempotent. Delta sync (`version_vector` /
  `delta_since` / `apply_delta`) preserves every character's `OpId` so a later
  concurrent edit merges without duplication.
- **`SeqCrdt`** — move-aware sequence CRDT. Each element is three independent
  LWW registers (value, position, deleted); a move is a single LWW reassignment
  of position so concurrent moves converge to the later stamp without
  duplication. Order is the lexicographic total order on `(frac, peer)`.

### CRDT registers (`lazily.crdt_registers`)

The `merge: crdt` register kinds (`protocol.md § Cell register types`):
`LwwRegister` (last-write-wins by HLC stamp; peer id is the final tiebreak),
`MvRegister` (multi-value — surfaces concurrent writes via a causal-context
`observed` set), `PnCounter` (positive-negative counter; per-peer `max` merge),
and `CellCrdt` (a CRDT cell wrapping an `LwwRegister` and propagating into the
reactive `Cell` plane, PartialEq-guarded after merge).

### Distributed CRDT plane (`lazily.crdt_plane`)

`CrdtPlaneRuntime` ingests state-based `CrdtOp`s and converges to the
greatest-stamp winner per `(node, key)` regardless of delivery order;
op-log dedup is keyed by `(node, stamp)` so re-delivering an already-seen frame
applies 0 new ops (state-based CvRDT idempotence). The runtime maintains the
per-peer stamp `frontier` and the causal-stability `watermark` (the `min` over
frontier membership) that gates tombstone GC. `to_sync()` / `delta_sync()`
publish anti-entropy `CrdtSync` frames.

### Signaling plane (`lazily.signaling`)

`SignalingFrame` is the typed envelope for the WebSocket signaling protocol;
`RoomCore` is the room state machine that implements the anti-spoof routing
invariant — a directed frame's `from` is the sender's server-registered peer id
(never client-supplied), the `welcome` roster excludes the joining peer's own
id, and `to`/`from` are never both present on one frame. `open` and `allowlist`
permission modes are supported; a concrete WebRTC backend is a platform adapter
behind the transport seam (the portable signaling stack + in-process loopback is
conformance-tested).

### State projection / mirror (`lazily.projection`)

`StateMirror` projects one local reactive context onto the `Snapshot`/`Delta`
wire plane. The value-mirror default resolves each invalidated allowlisted slot
at flush so the delta carries concrete `SlotValue`s; an eager `Computed` whose
value changed publishes a `SlotValue` for its backing slot; an equal recompute
(memo guard) suppresses both `SlotValue` and downstream invalidation. A
`PeerPermissions` boundary omits non-readable nodes entirely from both the
snapshot and the delta.

### Instrumentation / benchmarks (`lazily.benchmarks`)

`run_benchmarks()` micro-benchmarks the reactive core (cached read + invalidate
recompute), keyed reconciliation (LIS move-minimized diff), `SourceMap` insertion,
`TextCrdt` merge, and `CrdtPlaneRuntime` idempotent apply. Each entry reports
sample count, total elapsed, and per-op time; runnable as `python -m
lazily.benchmarks`.

### lazily-formal integration

`tests/test_formal_build.py` runs `lake build` over the sibling `lazily-formal`
Lean model and fails the suite if any theorem regresses (skipped when `lake` or
`lazily-formal` is absent, e.g. a standalone PyPI sdist checkout). The property
tests across `test_statechart_properties.py`, `test_thread_safe_properties.py`,
`test_async_slot_properties.py`, `test_async_effect_properties.py`,
`test_collection.py`, `test_tree.py`, and `test_reconciliation.py` mirror the
named Lean theorems — the universal guarantees no finite fixture suite can
establish.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Zero external dependencies (the `lazily.ipc` wire protocol uses only the
  standard-library `json` module)
