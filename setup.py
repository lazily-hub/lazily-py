"""lazily build script.

mypyc-compiles the reactive core (``slot`` / ``cell`` / ``signal`` / ``effect``
/ ``batch``) as a single compilation unit so cross-file native-class inheritance
(``BaseSlot`` → ``CellSlot``, ``Slot`` → ``Effect`` / ``_SignalSlot``) gets
mypyc's early binding. The public classes are decorated with
``@mypyc_attr(allow_interpreted_subclasses=True)`` so interpreted subclasses
(e.g. ``class HttpClient(Slot[...])``) keep working — this is the
``Py_TPFLAGS_BASETYPE``-equivalent that the prior mypyc attempt was missing.

Pure-Python fallback
--------------------
If mypyc is unavailable, or C compilation fails (no toolchain / unsupported
platform), the package builds as ordinary pure-Python with no extension modules.
The same ``.py`` sources then run uncompiled, so the package stays installable
everywhere — losing the mypyc speedup, keeping full correctness and the public
subclassable API. ``make compile`` rebuilds the in-place ``.so`` files for the
dev workflow; ``make build`` produces a wheel that ships the compiled ``.so``
alongside the ``.py`` sources.
