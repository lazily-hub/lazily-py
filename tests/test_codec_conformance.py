"""Frame-codec round-trip conformance (``#lzmsgpackparity``).

protocol.md § Frame codecs makes ``json`` (the reference codec) and ``msgpack``
(the cross-language binary default) MUST-level for every binding, and requires
every frame to round-trip through both for all three ``IpcMessage`` variants.
That requirement lived only in prose. The four conformance rungs — was the
fixture OPENED, were its keys CONSUMED, were they ASSERTED, was every SCENARIO
replayed — all reason about fixture *content*, and content replay never
exercises a codec, so a binding could carve out a MUST-level codec and stay
green on every rung.

lazily-py implements **both** halves (``#lzmsgpackseven``). The ``msgpack``
codec is dependency-free and derived from the same ``to_wire()`` value tree the
``json`` codec serializes, so the externally tagged envelope, the named-field
maps and both ``NodeKey`` rules are identical across the two by construction —
see ``lazily/msgpack_codec.py``.

The runner decodes ``wire``, **re-encodes the decoded message**, decodes again,
and evaluates every ``expect`` key against that second decode. Asserting
against the fixture literal would prove nothing: the literal never passed
through an encoder.

The msgpack half adds one thing the value assertions structurally cannot see.
Named-field encoding is a property of the ENCODING, not of any decoded value: a
positional encoder round-trips every field correctly and is still a private
codec no peer that negotiated ``msgpack`` could read. So the encoded bytes are
also introspected SCHEMA-LESSLY — decoded into a plain map/list tree — and the
envelope key plus the (sorted; map key order is encoder-defined) field names are
asserted against the fixture.
