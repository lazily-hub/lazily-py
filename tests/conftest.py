"""Runtime conformance manifest (#lazilyupgradeconformance).

The static coverage guard greps test sources for fixture filenames. That catches a
fixture nobody mentions, but not one mentioned in a comment and hand-transcribed —
the drift found in lazily-cpp's queue tests, where the source names the fixture and
the bytes are never opened. Only observing the read proves the corpus was replayed.

This wraps ``Path.read_text`` / ``Path.open`` for the session rather than editing
every load site, and that is the stronger instrument rather than the lazier one: it
records what the suite REALLY read, so a runner that stops loading a fixture is
caught even though its source still names it. Editing call sites would only record
what each site claims to load.

Writes to ``LAZILY_CONFORMANCE_MANIFEST``; a no-op when unset, so a bare
``pytest tests/`` is unaffected.
