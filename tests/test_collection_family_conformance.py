"""The keyed-collection ordering contract replayed against **all three**
execution flavors.

``test_collection_conformance.py`` already replays the ordering fixtures, but
only against the single-threaded :class:`SourceMap`. That is the blind spot this
file closes: :class:`ThreadSafeReactiveMap` and :class:`AsyncReactiveMap` shipped
``present_keys`` / ``present_count`` and nothing else — no ordering surface and no
reactive membership. The coverage matrix read OK because *a* flavor passed.

Invalidation is measured by **recompute count** inside the reader's own compute
body, not by a cache flag. A counter the library has to move is the one probe
that cannot be satisfied by runner bookkeeping.

    the key *precedes* its anchor — target ``anchor - 1`` — is never replayed.
    That is exactly the direction lazily-zig's ``moveBefore`` was wrong in:
    ``move_before("a","d")`` on ``[a,b,c,d]`` produced ``[b,c,d,a]``. The
    canonical corpus would have scored that binding green.

    The negative-index case covers a defect this work found in this binding:
    ``move_to`` clamped only the upper end, so a negative index reached Python's
    insert-from-the-right semantics and landed the key near the end instead of at
