"""Unconsumed-assertion-key guard for the conformance runners (#lzassertunknownkeys).

The coverage guard in ``scripts/check-conformance-coverage.sh`` proves a canonical
fixture's bytes were *read*. That is one level too shallow. A runner can read the
fixture, round-trip its ``wire`` frame, report the fixture as replayed — and never
look at the one assertion key the fixture exists for. Every named key the runner
does not recognise falls through silently; the suite is green and the assertion
proved nothing.

The concrete instance: ``delta_zero_copy_arrow.json`` carries a
``first_op_payload_backend`` discriminator. A runner that reads ``epoch`` and
``op_count`` and ignores the rest passes while never testing the backend at all.
Adding the missing check fixes one fixture. It does not fix the property, and the
property is what bites — a key no binding implements is invisibly skipped in all
nine at once.

This module makes the *unconsumed* key an error. Wrap an assertion/expectation
block with :func:`tracked`; every read through ``[]``, ``.get()``, ``in``, or a
generic iteration marks the key consumed. At the end of the session
``conftest.pytest_sessionfinish`` fails the run when a key present in a fixture was
never consumed by any runner, naming the fixture, the block, and the key.

Consumption is aggregated per ``(fixture, block)`` across the whole session, not
per test. Loading a fixture twice — a dedicated assertion test plus a parametrized
round-trip sweep — is normal, and the question worth answering is the session-wide
one: did *anything* in this suite check that key.

Python makes the silent path especially easy to reach: ``block.get("key")`` on a
key the fixture never had returns ``None`` and asserts nothing, and ``**block``
splats whatever is there into a callee that ignores extras. The tracker is the
same instrument for both — it reports on what was *taken out* of the block, not on
what the runner claims to look for.

Read is not asserted (#lzconsumednotasserted)
---------------------------------------------
Proving a key was *read* is still one rung short. A runner can read a key and then
do nothing with it — three shapes seen in the wild:

1. a named skip inside a loop that iterates the block (the iteration marks every
   key consumed, then the body ``continue``s past the interesting one);
2. a value bound to a local that no later comparison uses;
3. a comparison against a *literal* rather than against the fixture's own value,
   so the fixture field gates a branch instead of being checked.

So the ledger records a second set: which keys reached a comparison against the
fixture's value. The only ways in are :func:`assert_key` (equality against the
fixture value), :func:`assert_key_with` (any predicate, handed the fixture value),
and whole-block equality — an arm that compares against a hand-written constant
never marks the key, because the fixture's value never reached the comparison.

There is a fourth shape of the same defect, one level in from (2):

4. a predicate that RECEIVES the fixture value and never reads it.

``assert_key`` compares by construction and cannot have it. ``assert_key_with``
marks the key asserted on the strength of the callback's verdict, so a callback
that ignores its argument books a satisfied obligation having compared nothing —
lazily-cs shipped exactly that, an ``Assert.All`` over the fixture's own array
that asserted a property of an ENUM and never touched the replay, vacuously true
on an empty array and still marked SATISFIED. So ``assert_key_with`` hands the
callback a RECORDING view of the value and fails when nothing read it
(``#lzunboundblockguard``). See :data:`UNPROXYABLE_VALUE_TYPES` for the value
types Python leaves out of reach.

Where a key genuinely cannot be checked at the call site — the binding proves the
fact elsewhere, or the field is a discriminator selecting a code path rather than a
value — :func:`excuse_key` records the key and a non-empty reason. Excuses run in
**both** directions, exactly like the ``KNOWN_UNCOVERED`` coverage allowlist:
excusing a key the same session also asserts is a failure, because the excuse has
gone stale and is now hiding nothing.

Prose keys
----------
A few canonical fixtures carry human-readable narration inside an assertion block
(``note``, ``reason``, and similar). Those are not assertions and cannot be
"implemented". Declare them per call site with ``prose=(...)`` so the exemption is
visible next to the runner that takes it, rather than buried in a global
allowlist. Prose is exempt from all three verdicts. Everything else must be
consumed *and* asserted (or excused) or the guard fails.

Declared prose keys are DISCHARGED, not excused (#lzprosekeyconvention)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The paragraph above describes narration a runner may ignore. A *declared* prose
key is the opposite: it states an OBLIGATION in English, and the corpus now says
which keys those are, in the block's own ``assertions.prose`` array. lazily-spec
``docs/conformance.md`` § Prose assertion keys is normative; this module is the
lazily-py half of it.

Replaying ``blob_backend_discriminator.json`` v2 produced four different
treatments of the same four paragraphs across the nine bindings. lazily-py's was
the second-best of the four — it excused each one with an individually-worded
reason naming the assertion that discharges it, which is falsifiable in
principle and was checked by nothing. The convention makes exactly that claim
checkable, and deletes the free-text form so there are not two paths to satisfy
one key.

A declared prose key is satisfied by :func:`prose_key`, which names the
executable assertion keys that carry its obligation, and by nothing else. The
tracker fails the run when:

1. a declared prose key is ASSERTED — comparing a paragraph, or a tally derived
   from one, to an English string pins wording, not behaviour;
2. a declared prose key is EXCUSED with free text — the unfalsifiable form;
3. a key *not* declared prose is discharged;
4. the discharged set differs from ``assertions.prose`` — the comparison that
   consumes ``prose`` itself, and what makes a forgotten key fail rather than
   vanish;
5. a discharge names no keys;
6. a discharge names a key this fixture's run did not assert — the rule that
   makes the excuse falsifiable at all;
7. a discharge names a key that is itself prose, **or names ``prose``**. The
   second half is not redundant: the declaration never self-lists, so without
   it rule 7 misses ``discharged_by=["prose"]`` — and rule 4's own comparison
   marks ``prose`` asserted, so rule 6 would then wave it through.

Which rules are block-local and which are fixture-wide
------------------------------------------------------
The declaration is BLOCK-local: each block owns its own ``prose`` array, and
rules 3 and 4 compare a block's discharged set against that block's array. Only
the NAME MATCHING of rules 6 and 7 is fixture-wide, because that is the half
that has to reach a per-scenario ``expect`` key — ``epoch_disambiguation`` sits
in ``assertions`` and is discharged by ``expect.frame_epoch`` /
``expect.blob_epoch``, asserted long after the ``assertions`` block is finished.

And a RUN is one test, not one process. Rungs 2 and 3 aggregate over the whole
session on purpose ("did anything in this suite check that key"); rule 6 asks
the narrower question, so :data:`_RUN_ASSERTED` is cleared at each
:func:`verify_prose`. Unioning asserted keys across tests would let a discharge
in one test be satisfied by an assertion in another — the same accident of
collocation the fixture-scoped ledger exists to bound.

The verdict lands at :func:`verify_prose`, and a run that never verifies fails
from ``conftest.pytest_sessionfinish``: an unverified discharge claim is exactly
as unchecked as an unconsumed key. That seam already owns the block's
consumption check and is structurally guaranteed to run last, which is why the
net is armed there rather than from a teardown registered by the first
``prose_key`` call — cleanup runs in reverse registration order, so such a net
would fire BEFORE a verification registered earlier in the same body and report
a false failure.

A discharge may name a key that carries the obligation only by PROXY, and two
in the corpus must: ``wire_encoding`` is a claim about how the corpus carries
its bytes, which no assertion a *run* makes can observe, and ``theorem`` names
a Lean theorem in lazily-formal. Naming the closest executable keys is
conforming; naming a key with nothing to do with the obligation is not, and no
tracker can tell the two apart. That judgement stays with review, which is why
the discharge is written at the call site and says there that it is a proxy.

``note`` / ``description`` / ``reason`` inside a per-step or per-scenario block
stay exempt BY NAME (:data:`PROSE_KEYS`) — the ~97 step notes in the
reactive-graph corpus are annotations, not obligations. That exemption stops at
the block's own declaration, applied FIRST: a key listed in ``assertions.prose``
is NOT satisfied by the blanket, even when it is spelled ``note``. See
:meth:`_Ledger.blanket_exempt` — this is the hole two of the nine bindings fell
into, and it silently voids the convention for both ``frame_roundtrip``
fixtures.

Object-valued keys are checked by their KEY SET (#lzsubblockkeyset)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Every rung above reasons about the keys of a *block*. An assertion key whose
VALUE is a JSON object has a key set of its own, one level down, and nothing
above looks at it: a runner that checks five named sub-fields of
``arena_blob.json``'s ``assertions.descriptor`` stays green when the corpus
grows a sixth, because the sixth is compared by nothing. That is the null form
of ``#lznullformblind`` again — this time *inside* an assertion key rather than
beside one. The zig corpus-perturbation pass found it by planting a key there
and watching every scalar sibling redden while the object stayed silent.

The cheap fix is a field count written at each call site, and it is the wrong
one: it relies on every site remembering, which is the property that failed. So
the obligation lives in the TRACKER, which already holds a block's key set, and
there are exactly two ways to discharge it:

1. :meth:`TrackedBlock.sub` — DESCEND. Hands back a child tracker bound to the
   object, which owns the unconsumed/unasserted verdicts for every key beneath
   it. A sub-key nobody reads fails exactly the way an unread top-level key
   does.
2. :func:`assert_key_set` — compare the object's KEY SET against the set the run
   really produced, in BOTH directions. A fixture token nothing replayed and a
   replayed token the fixture omits are both failures. This is the form for a
   VOCABULARY, where the values are English glosses and only the names are the
   assertion (``codec/nodeid_exact_range.json``'s ``assertions.outcomes``).

:func:`assert_invalidates` is a third, narrower form of (2) held inside the
tracker for the same reason, and marks its key checked itself.

The guard that makes this not-optional lands in :func:`consumption_failures`: an
assertion key whose fixture value is a JSON object, consumed and not run through
one of those, FAILS as "object-valued key consumed without a key-set check".
Plain :func:`assert_key` / :func:`assert_key_with` deliberately do NOT satisfy
it — a predicate reading five named sub-fields is precisely the per-call-site
field list this rung removes, and equality against a dict the call site builds
by hand is the same list spelled as a literal. :func:`excuse_key` and the prose
channels stay available for an object that genuinely carries no obligation, and
they already require a recorded reason.

Scenario was never replayed (#lzscenariocoverage)
-------------------------------------------------
The rungs above all reason about the scenarios a runner *reached*. A fixture that
carries several named scenarios can be PARTIALLY replayed and none of them
notices: the coverage guard only asks whether the file was opened (one scenario is
enough), and the key trackers only bind blocks a runner actually walks, so a
scenario nobody enters contributes no unconsumed key and no unasserted key. It is
invisible by construction.

So there is a fourth ledger here, recording which scenario ids the run really
replayed. Its shape mirrors the runtime fixture manifest deliberately: a
hand-authored list of "scenarios this binding covers" is a claim, and a claim
rots.

The recording happens at the point of replay, and *yielding is not replaying*: a
generator cannot tell a loop body that ran from one that ``continue``d past the
scenario, so booking at the yield would call a skipped scenario covered — the very
defect. :func:`scenarios` therefore hands out a view that books on the first read
of the scenario's PAYLOAD (``steps``, ``ops``, ``frames``, ``expect``, …) and
stays silent for :data:`SCENARIO_LABEL_KEYS` (``id``, ``name``, …), which is what
a skip reads on its way past. Runners that pick a scenario out by name wrap it the
same way through :func:`scenario_view`.

Ids resolve in one fixed order shared by every binding: ``id``, else ``name``.
There is no third option (``#lzspecscenarioids``): a positional ``#<n>`` id
silently rebinds to a different scenario when the corpus array is reordered, so
an unidentified scenario is a FAILURE rather than a note. lazily-spec's
``scenario-identity-check`` keeps the corpus side of that invariant.

Verification runs in both directions at session end, like ``KNOWN_UNCOVERED`` and
like :func:`excuse_key`: a scenario on disk that the run never replayed fails
unless :func:`excuse_scenario` names it with a reason; an excuse for a scenario the
same run DID replay fails as stale; and an excuse naming an id the fixture does not
carry fails as rotted.

# Rung 0: the assertion-block BIND ledger (#lznullformblind)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every rung above this one is scoped to a block some runner already BOUND to a
# tracker. The unconsumed-key guard fires on a key nothing read; the
# read-but-unasserted guard on a key read and discarded; the prose ledger on a
# discharge naming nothing. None of them can fire for a block NO runner ever
# bound, because there is no ledger for it at all: its keys are not unread —
# nothing reads them, and the fixture reports exactly nothing. lazily-dart found
# two such blocks carrying eight silent keys, one of them the anti-spoof
# invariant its fixture exists for; lazily-cpp found a third.
#
# So the loader inventories every assertion-bearing block at READ time (the
# ``Path.read_text`` recorder in ``conftest.py``) and ``TrackedBlock.__init__``
# books one as BOUND. The two sides are matched by the block's CONTENT digest and
# never by its ``where`` label: runners spell those labels inconsistently
# (``assertions``, ``frames[warn].assertions``, ``scenarios[3].expect``) and a
# label-keyed ledger would silently miss the mismatch rather than report it.
#
# The inventory walk is the WHOLE of ``BLOCK_KEYS`` at EVERY depth, mirroring
# :func:`instrument` exactly (#lzunboundblockguard). It used to be ``assertions``
# only, top level plus one hard-coded level inside ``frames``/``scenarios``/
# ``rejects`` — which inventoried 31 blocks out of the 578 the same 139 opened
# fixtures carry, so every ``expect`` block in the corpus was outside the rung
# that exists to catch a block nothing binds. Widening it found 25 real ones here
# (the per-step ``expect`` blocks of the six parked merge-feed fixtures). The
# narrow walk is also how lazily-dart's dead per-frame ``assertions`` blocks
# stayed invisible: they were found by FLIPPING fixture values (#lzperturbaudit)
# and reporting no failure, never by a guard.

#: An assertion block that genuinely cannot be bound belongs HERE, as a
#: documented excuse the guard reads on every run, not as a runner fabricated to
#: manufacture coverage. Keys are ``"fixture|where"``; values are non-empty
#: reasons — an excuse with no reason is an unexplained gap wearing a green badge.
#:
#: Checked in BOTH directions, like every other ledger in this module: an entry
#: whose block IS bound fails as stale, and an entry naming a block an opened
#: fixture no longer carries fails as rotted. A one-directional allowlist only
#: ever grows, and an excuse nobody can be forced to delete is the undocumented
#: default it was written to replace.
#:
#: The current entries are the per-step ``expect`` blocks of the six merge-feed
#: fixtures ``tests/test_reactive_graph_conformance.py`` skips in EVERY context
#: (its ``MERGEFEED_SKIPS``). Five drive the ``merge_cell`` op, which lazily-py's
#: reactive graph ships no node kind for; the sixth asserts the novel
#: ``drain_exhausted`` key. The runner's pre-flight rejects each fixture before a
#: single step runs, so no ``expect`` under it is ever bound. When the op lands,
#: every entry below fails as stale and has to be deleted — which is the point of
#: writing them per SITE rather than per fixture.

#: fails a block that is neither bound nor ledgered. A commit that detaches a bind
#: and writes the matching entry violates none of them — the two sides agree, at a
#: worse level of coverage.
#:
#: The magnitude rung above does not see it either, and that is not a gap in how

#:
#: What closes it is not another measurement but a POLICY, compared against a

#:
#: It is an EQUALITY, and that is the correction ``#lzledgerratchet`` makes to the

#: detach-and-excuse pair only while the slack is zero, so the first migration
#: that shrinks the ledger without lowering the bound buys one free detachment,
#: the next buys another, and the bound converges on a large unreachable number
#: that never fires — which is exactly how the hand-retyped declared-block floor
#: this module retired came to sit 42 blocks behind reality. An equality has no
#: slack by construction and cannot drift silently, because a stale value FAILS:

#: sites were migrated and this pin was not lowered in the same commit. Both are
#: things a person must see. A number that fails when it is stale is a ratchet,
#: not a pin that rots.
#:
#: Raising it is legitimate and is meant to be conspicuous — a corpus that gains a
#: genuinely unreachable fixture is the real case — but it is a decision to prove
#: less than the previous commit proved, so it belongs in its own commit with a
#: reason. Lowering it is the reward for a migration and belongs in the same
#: commit as the bind.
#:
#: Checked UNCONDITIONALLY, unlike the derived magnitude. That one is gated on the
#: run having opened canonical fixtures, because it compares the run against the

#: Positive-evidence magnitude (``#lzvacuousrun`` / ``#lzblockfloorpin``). Zero
#: declared blocks means zero unbound blocks, which reports OK having compared
#: nothing, so how much the run inventoried is asserted and not only that nothing
#: it inventoried was unbound.
#:
#: This is DERIVED and it is an EQUALITY, not a floor and not a typed constant.
#: It used to be both: a ``MIN_DECLARED_BLOCKS`` literal, re-pinned by hand at
#: 31 -> 578 -> 620, carrying a docstring that warned the convention rots — and
#: then demonstrated it. The pin sat at 578 from 2026-08-11 while the real
#: inventory was 620, so 42 blocks could have stopped being inventoried with this
#: rung still green (``#lzscenariofloordrift``). A number a person retypes after
#: reading a log lags the corpus by however long nobody reads the log, and a
#: ``>=`` comparison cannot notice the lag at all.
#:
#: The two inputs both move on their own:
#:
#:   1. the CANONICAL corpus directory listing (:func:`default_corpus_dir` — the
#:      lazily-spec sibling, NOT the ``LAZILY_SPEC_CONFORMANCE_DIR`` override; see
#:      :func:`expected_declared_blocks`), and
#:   2. this binding's own committed ledger of the fixtures it does NOT open —
#:      ``KNOWN_UNCOVERED`` in ``scripts/check-conformance-coverage.sh``.
#:
#: Corpus minus ledger is exactly the set this suite opens; the coverage guard
#: asserts that same identity from the runtime manifest, from the other side.
#: Walking those fixtures with :func:`iter_declared_blocks` — the SAME walk the
#: loader-side inventory uses, so the two sides cannot disagree about what counts
#: as a block — yields the distinct digests the run owes. A fixture landing
#: upstream moves this number with no edit here; a fixture this binding stops
#: opening moves it only through a committed ledger line.
#:
#: What it deliberately does NOT read: :data:`_DECLARED_FIXTURES`, conftest's
#: ``_opened``, or anything else this run produced. An expectation derived from
#: what the run read goes to zero alongside the actual count the moment the loader
#: detaches, and the rung is vacuously green again — the ``#lzvacuousrun`` failure
#: the floor existed to prevent.
#:
#: The walk is object-valued blocks only, matching :func:`iter_declared_blocks`.
#: That is why this binding derives a different number from a sibling over an
#: almost identical opened set: an array-valued tracked key contributes no site
#: here and does contribute one in bindings that descend into array elements.

#: The committed ledger the opened set is derived from. Parsed out of the shell
#: script rather than restated in Python: a second copy would be one more thing to
#: re-pin by hand, which is the defect being removed. Keeping the array in the
#: script is also an upstream constraint — lazily-spec's ``check-corpus-floors.mjs``
#: classifies the ledger arrays declared there and fails on an unclassified one.
