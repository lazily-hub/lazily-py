"""Blob-backend discriminator strictness on decode (``#lzblobbackendstrict``).

protocol.md § Shared-memory payload path makes ``ShmBlobRef.backend`` optional
with a default of ``shm``, and that OPTIONALITY is the forward-compatibility
channel: it carries every descriptor minted before the field existed. A PRESENT
value outside the enum is a different fact and gets the opposite answer — the
decoder MUST reject the frame and NAME the token, rather than normalize it to
``shm``, to another backend, or to a sentinel.

lazily-py was one of the five bindings that normalized, and documented the
normalization as forward-compat. The first half of that reasoning was right and
is exactly why absence stays lenient. The second half was not: a new backend
enters the protocol by *adding an enum value* (``docs/zero-copy-transport.md``
§ Pluggable backends — a spec change carrying a fixture), so an unknown token is
a corrupt or non-conforming producer, never a newer peer. And reading an unknown
kind as ``shm`` **is** routing a non-shm descriptor into the shm table, which
inverts the ``resolve_wrong_backend`` theorem in that same doc: it leaves a
64-bit checksum to discharge probabilistically what routing was supposed to
guarantee structurally.

Fixture v2 (14 scenarios: seven wire shapes x two codecs) adds the four facts v1
declared or implied without carrying, and this runner replays all of them:

* ``in_process`` — the THIRD declared backend. v1 shipped scenarios for two of
  the three names in ``assertions.backends``, so a binding that knew only
  ``{shm, arrow}`` refused ``in_process`` *conformingly by the letter of the
  clause* and passed all eight v1 scenarios. The control is a SET DIFFERENCE
  (``declared - decoded``), not a scenario count — see
  :func:`_assert_backend_vocabulary_is_complete`.
* an explicit ``null`` — the ABSENT form (§ NodeKey, ``#lzkeynullstrict``), not a
  present-unknown one. A serde-style peer that skipped ``skip_serializing_if``
  emits ``null`` where a conforming encoder omits, so refusing it is stricter
  than the reference implementation on a frame the reference implementation
  produces.
* a non-string ``backend`` — the same refusal reached through a door the clause,
  written entirely about TOKENS, does not describe. The refusal must arrive
  through the codec's documented decode-error family, so this runner catches
  ``Exception`` and asserts membership rather than pinning the family in a
  ``pytest.raises``: a ``TypeError`` from downstream string handling refuses the
  frame while failing PAST every caller's decode handler, and a
  ``pytest.raises(ValueError)`` cannot tell that apart from a conforming refusal.
* ``frame_epoch`` vs ``blob_epoch`` — v1 carried 9 in both the Delta frame and
  the ShmBlobRef descriptor, so one ``expect.epoch`` was satisfied by a runner
  reading either. They are separate facts (the frame epoch orders deltas, the
  descriptor epoch names the arena incarnation) and are now asserted separately
  against their own sources.

The fixture carries its frames as raw text (json) and hex (msgpack) on purpose.
``schemas/defs.json`` closes ``backend`` to an enum, so the reject frames AND the
null frames are schema-INVALID by design and cannot be carried as parsed objects
— the enum binds a conforming ENCODER, and these frames are what a DECODER must
survive. This runner therefore decodes from the raw form and never re-serializes
a parsed scenario body.

Both halves of the clause are checked. Reading the field is only the decode half
— a binding that echoes whatever it received back out has a correct decoded
value and a non-conforming encoder — so each accepted scenario re-encodes under
its own codec and inspects the produced frame's field set.
