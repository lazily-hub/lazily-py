"""Tests for the conformance assertion ledger itself.

Three rungs live here (#lzassertunknownkeys, #lzconsumednotasserted,
#lzscenariocoverage). The ledger is
the thing that decides whether a conformance failure is reported at all, so it
needs its own coverage: a guard that quietly stops reporting is the same silent
skip one level up. And the second rung exists precisely because *reading* a key
looked identical to *checking* it — so these tests assert that a read which never
reaches a comparison is reported, and that an excuse which has stopped hiding
anything is reported too.

Each test leaves the session ledger clean — it either satisfies every key it
declares or drops its own fixture with ``reset(fixture=...)`` — because
``conftest.pytest_sessionfinish`` fails the run on anything left behind, and a
self-test must not fail the suite it is checking.
