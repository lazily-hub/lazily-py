"""``NodeKey`` null-leniency on decode (``#lzkeynullstrict``).

protocol.md § NodeKey said a self-describing codec OMITS an absent ``key``, and
that a decoder seeing no ``key`` field treats it as absent. That settled the
omitted form and left an explicit ``key: null`` undefined — and three bindings
diverged there. The clause is now explicit: **omit-when-absent binds the
ENCODER, and a decoder MUST accept both forms as absent**, refusing neither and
constructing a key from neither.

lazily-py was one of the three that refused. ``"key" in d`` is true for the null
form, so ``None`` reached ``NodeKey.from_wire`` and raised ``NodeKeyError`` —
"node key path is empty". Note where it was already right: ``CrdtOp.from_wire``
one field over used ``d.get("key")`` and compared against ``None``, because a
``CrdtOp`` ALWAYS writes ``key: null`` when unset. Same file, same field name,
opposite behaviour.

The runner checks both halves. Reading the null form as absent is only half the
rule — a binding that writes it straight back out has a correct decoded value
and a non-conforming encoder — so each scenario re-encodes under its own codec
and inspects the produced frame's field set.

And it classifies the ``key`` slot out of the RAW wire before any decode runs
(``#lznullformblind``). Every key in this fixture's ``expect`` blocks is
byte-identical across the ``omitted`` and ``null`` families — reading an
explicit ``key: null`` as absent IS the leniency — so the four ``null``
scenarios were the four ``omitted`` ones wearing a different id as far as any
post-decode assertion could tell. ``key_form`` came from the fixture's own
label, so the label was trusted rather than checked; the classification now
comes off the ``wire_json`` text and the ``wire_msgpack_hex`` bytes and is
asserted against that label.
