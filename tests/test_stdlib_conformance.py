# its own `mutation_floor`, which is a claim satisfied by its own bookkeeping
# (feedback_conformance_tests_drive_real_behavior_not_runner_bookkeeping). An
# operator rebound to a scenario it does not break stayed green.
#
# The reference shape is lazily-rs `tests/stdlib_conformance.rs`
# (`independent_failures(path, &fixture, Some(operator))`). The design point
# worth restating: the operator perturbs an INDEPENDENT model of the feature,
# never the shipped `lazily.stdlib` implementation. Mutating production code to
# test the corpus would test the mutation harness, would need the library to
# carry seams that exist only for tests, and would say nothing about whether the
# corpus can TELL a correct implementation from a wrong one — which is the only
# thing the ledger claims.
