"""Conformance tests for the signaling plane.

Replays ``conformance/signaling/anti_spoof_session.json`` through
:class:`lazily.signaling.RoomCore` and asserts the exact frame transcript the
anti-spoof invariant requires: a directed frame's ``from`` is the sender's
server-registered peer id (never client-supplied), the ``welcome`` roster
excludes the joining peer, and ``to``/``from`` are never both present.

Also round-trips every frame in ``conformance/signaling/frames.json``: each
frame's canonical JSON survives :meth:`SignalingFrame.to_wire` /
:meth:`SignalingFrame.from_wire` unchanged.
