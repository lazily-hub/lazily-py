"""Reactive-graph conformance runner against canonical lazily-spec fixtures.

Executes the JSON fixtures in ``lazily-spec/conformance/reactive-graph``
**directly** — this is a fixture *interpreter*, not a hand-transcribed replay.
Transcriptions and bundled copies drift from the spec, so the canonical files
are read from the sibling checkout and never vendored here.

Fixture path resolution mirrors ``lazily-rs``
(``tests/reactive_graph_conformance.rs``, ``#lzspecconf``): one sibling-relative
``SPEC_DIR`` constant, skip with an explicit message when it is absent, and a CI
guard that asserts the directory exists so the skip can never silently pass —
see the "Assert canonical lazily-spec fixtures are present" step in
``.github/workflows/precommit.yml``.

## Replayed against every context lazily-py ships

The corpus runs against :class:`~lazily.cell.Cell`/:class:`~lazily.slot.Slot`
(the synchronous graph), :class:`~lazily.thread_safe.ThreadSafeContext`, and
:class:`~lazily.async_context.AsyncContext`. Replaying only the default context
is exactly how the ``lazily-dart`` and ``lazily-go`` invalidation-cascade
defects hid: both were correct synchronously and broken asynchronously. The
async path — where staleness is tracked by revision counters and in-flight
state rather than a pull chain — is the one the transitive-depth fixture was
written to discriminate (``#lzdartobservercow``), and it is also where a
disposal that forgets to dirty the survivors is hardest to notice.

## Coverage

The whole corpus replays: the teardown-scope vocabulary (``begin_scope`` /
``end_scope`` / ``disarm``), ``effect``, ``dispose``, ``fanout`` / ``churn`` /
``dispose_fanout`` / ``dispose_stale_handle``, degree introspection
(``dependents_of`` / ``dependencies_of``), and the signal-eagerness vocabulary
(``signal`` / ``dispose_signal`` / ``batch`` with the ``computes_of``
observable). ``computes_of`` is the cumulative number of times a node's compute
has run, counted by the synthesized compute itself: an eager signal and a lazy
memo return identical values for every read sequence in those fixtures, so a
runner that inferred the count instead of measuring it would pass against a
``signal()`` that is really a ``memo()``. Op support is per-context — see
:data:`EXPECTED_SKIPS`. Both fixture shapes execute:
``steps``, and ``scenarios`` — which exists because a claim like
``observationally_equal`` is a *relation between two op streams* that a single
``steps`` array cannot express, so each scenario is replayed in its own context
and the resulting observations compared.

## Findings, not relaxations (``#lzspecconf``)

Assertion failures are *recorded* rather than raised, so one run reports the
whole corpus instead of stopping at the first divergence, and the recorded set
is reconciled against :data:`KNOWN_DIVERGENCES` exactly. A new divergence fails
the build and a fixed one fails it until its entry is removed. No fixture is
ever edited and no assertion ever loosened to make that list shorter.

## Positive assertion (``#lzspecconf``)

An absence guard is not enough: a runner that skips everything must fail. For
each model this asserts (a) the fixture set on disk matches :data:`FIXTURES`
exactly, (b) the set actually replayed matches :data:`EXPECTED_REPLAYED`
exactly, (c) the observed skips match :data:`EXPECTED_SKIPS` exactly, and (d) a
non-zero number of fixtures, ops and assertions actually executed. A runner
that can pass while executing nothing is the anti-pattern this file exists to
kill.
