"""``NodeId`` exact-representation bound (``#lzspecdecoderbound``).

protocol.md § NodeId / PeerId stated the 2^53 bound as a PRODUCER obligation and
said nothing about what a decoder does when it receives a violation. That left
the receiving half undefined, which is exactly where the bindings diverged. The
clause is now normative: **a decoder that cannot represent a received identifier
exactly MUST reject the frame rather than round it.**

lazily-py is the one binding with nothing to refuse. A Python ``int`` is
arbitrary-precision, so ``NodeId`` has no upper bound and every scenario — up to
``u64::MAX`` — decodes exactly. This runner therefore asserts the ``exact``
branch for all six, which makes it a *floor*: a scenario that is rejectable here
means the fixture is wrong about the wire rather than about any decoder.

The fixture carries its wire frames as raw text (json) and hex (msgpack) and its
expected identifier as a decimal string. Python would not round a bare
``9007199254740993`` while loading the file, but the contract is uniform across
the nine bindings on purpose — the ones backed by doubles would, and a fixture
that reads differently per runtime is not one fixture.
